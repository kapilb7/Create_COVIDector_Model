# Creating COVIDector Models
<h2>Creating the Models from scratch</h2>
Refer to <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/Create_COVIDector_Model/blob/main/Create_COVIDector_Dataset.ipynb">Create_COVIDector_Dataset.ipynb</a>, if you want to create the model from scratch, right from creating the dataset.
<br> Refer to <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/Create_COVIDector_Model/blob/main/Create_COVIDNet.ipynb">Create_COVIDNet.ipynb</a>, to create the TensorFlow model.
<br> Refer to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/">this documentation</a> provided by Apple, to create the CoreML model, using Create ML.

Refer to the Inference.py file, to test the TensorFlow Lite model with any ransome sample X-ray image.

<h3>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/COVIDector">COVIDector project here</a>, supports iOS/iPadOS. </h3>
<h3>Note: This is far from production ready.</h3>
<h3>This was part of my Final Year Project for my undergraduate course.</h3>
