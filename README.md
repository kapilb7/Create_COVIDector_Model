Refer to <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/Create_COVIDector_Model/blob/main/Create_COVIDector_Dataset.ipynb">this file</a>, if you wanto to create the model from scratch, right from creating the dataset.

<br> Refer to <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/Create_COVIDector_Model/blob/main/Create_COVIDNet.ipynb">this file</a> to create the Tensorflow Model.

<br> Refer to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/">this documentation</a> provided by Apple, to create the CoreML, using Create ML.

<h3>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/kapilb7/COVIDector">COVIDector project here</a>, supports iOS/iPadOS. </h3>
<h3>Note: This is far from production ready.</h3>
<h3>This was part of my Final Year Project for my undergraduate course.</h3>
